### What?

This library leverages hardware acceleration in CSS to translate, rotate, scale and fade any web element.

Right now I have included text, images, iFrames and Font Awesome icons which collectively cover a wide range of potential uses.

The state is stored to local storage so that it persists between page loads and you can also export/import the state to back it up or share with others.

Hopefully the drag and drop interface is clear enough to explain itself.

### Why?

The initial idea for this project stemmed from a lack of open source tools to be able to create explainer videos.
If you want to express a complex technical concept or workflow then you have to pay for a tool, which may not fully suit your needs, or pay an animator to create a video for you.

Here is an example of the sort of thing I would like to achieve with this library: [Spotify video](https://vimeo.com/26427650)

If you are a web developer then this will make sense to you since everything is handled by old fashioned CSS.

It may be that you have some other interesting use case for this, if so then please get in contact and we can discuss it.

### How can I contribute?

There is a to do list of issues in mobx store which would be a great place to start.
You can also always message me at <charles@appsapiens.uk> to find out more.
